# Climate Risk Management

Climate risk management (CRM) is the systematic process used to assess, anticipate, and address risks posed by climate change and variability to human, ecological, and economic systems. The goal is to build societal resilience and strengthen preparedness, prevention, response, and recovery for climate-related hazards.

## Framework and Principles

CRM integrates climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction within a sustainable development strategy. It addresses both acute (extreme events) and chronic (long-term changes) climate risks. There are three pillars:

- **Averting Risks:** Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change at the source.
- **Minimizing Risks:** Implementing adaptation and risk management strategies (early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, policy changes).
- **Addressing Residual Risks:** Using risk transfer measures (insurance, finance), disaster response, and social protection to manage impacts that can't be avoided.

## Identification and Assessment

CRM begins by identifying climate hazards relevant to the context, such as floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms, or sea-level rise. Techniques include:

- Geographic hazard mapping (overlaying climate data with vulnerable sites)
- Vulnerability analyses for built and natural environments
- Risk quantification (frequency, severity, and potential impact)
- Scenario modeling and probability analysis over short, medium, and long-term horizons

## Risk Management Measures

- Mainstreaming climate risk into institutional policy and sectoral planning
- Infrastructure adaptationâ€”retrofitting, elevating structures, and using climate-resilient materials
- Early warning systems using climate and hazard data for actionable alerts
- Community engagement and capacity building for risk awareness

## Monitoring, Reporting, and Improvement

Monitoring involves tracking risk metrics, adaptation progress, and mitigation outcomes. CRM relies on timely, accurate reporting and the ability to revise strategies as new science and climate patterns emerge.

## Instruments and Innovations

Innovative approaches include climate-risk insurance, catastrophe bonds, climate-resilient agricultural practices, and the use of advanced AI/data analytics for hazard prediction and planning.
