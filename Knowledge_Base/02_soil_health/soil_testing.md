# Soil Testing: Procedures, Parameters, and Interpretation

## Importance
- Determines soil fertility, nutrient availability, pH, salinity, and organic matter.
- Guides precise fertilizer application, reducing cost and environmental impact.
- Helps detect soil constraints early.

## Sampling Procedure
- Collect soil from root zone (0-15 cm depth for most crops).
- Take multiple samples to form a representative composite.
- Avoid sampling near manure heaps, roads, or unusual spots.
- Use clean tools, package and label samples carefully.

## Soil Testing Parameters
- **Physical:** Texture, moisture content.
- **Chemical:** pH, electrical conductivity (salinity).
- **Nutrients:** Macronutrients (N, P, K), secondary nutrients (Ca, Mg, S), micronutrients (B, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Mo).
- **Organic Matter:** Carbon content and stability.

## Laboratory Analysis
- Methods include chemical extraction and instrumental analysis for nutrient levels.
- Results compared to sufficiency ranges and deficiency thresholds.

## Interpretation of Results
- Based on crop and soil type, recommend fertilizer doses and amendments.
- Suggest lime or sulfur to correct pH.
- Identify salinity and sodicity issues for remedial action.

## Rapid Field Tests
- Portable kits for NPK and pH estimation.
- Useful for quick field decisions with less accuracy.

## Testing Frequency
- Recommended every 2â€“3 years or before cropping seasons.
- Retest after major amendments or in problem areas.

## Best Practices
- Keep records of soil test results.
- Integrate with plant tissue testing for balanced nutrition.
- Use spatial mapping for variable rate fertilizer application.
