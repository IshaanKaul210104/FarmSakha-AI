# Soil Organic Matter (SOM): Importance, Types, and Management

## What is Soil Organic Matter?
Soil Organic Matter (SOM) is composed of decomposed plant and animal residues, living microorganisms, and humus (stable organic compounds). It is the key indicator of soil health and fertility.

## Importance of SOM
- **Improves Soil Structure:** Enhances aggregation and porosity, improving aeration, water infiltration, and root penetration.
- **Enhances Water Retention:** Holds moisture, crucial for drought resilience.
- **Nutrient Reservoir:** Stores and slowly releases essential nutrients (N, P, S).
- **Supports Microbial Activity:** Provides energy for microbes involved in nutrient cycling and disease suppression.
- **Stabilizes pH:** Buffers against soil acidity/alkalinity changes.
- **Reduces Erosion:** Improves soil cohesion to reduce loss by wind and water.
- **Carbon Sequestration:** Mitigates climate change by storing carbon.

## Sources of Organic Matter
- **Farm Yard Manure (FYM)**
- **Compost** from crop residues and animal wastes
- **Green Manures** such as sunhemp, dhaincha
- **Vermicompost**
- **Biochar**

## Management Practices
- Minimize tillage to protect organic layers.
- Regularly add FYM, compost, and incorporate crop residues.
- Use cover crops and green manures to boost biomass input.
- Avoid burning residues which depletes organic matter.
- Maintain soil moisture for microbial activity.

## Measuring SOM
- Laboratory tests measure Soil Organic Carbon (SOC); SOM ≈ SOC × 1.72.
- Typical agricultural soils contain 1-6% SOM.
- Higher SOM (>2%) is desirable for productive agriculture.

## Benefits to Crop Production
- Improved seed germination and root development.
- Increased nutrient use efficiency.
- Better resistance to drought and soil-borne diseases.
- Enhanced sustainable long-term productivity.
