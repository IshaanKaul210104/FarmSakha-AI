- Crop rotations and intercropping to maintain soil health.
- Biological pest control using natural predators and biopesticides.
- Conservation of biodiversity and on-farm water management.
- Avoidance of chemical residues ensuring safe, nutritious food.

## Methods

- **Soil Fertility:** Composting, vermicomposting, green manuring.
- **Pest and Weed Management:** Cultural methods, biocontrol, mechanical weeding.
- **Seed Selection:** Use of open-pollinated and heirloom varieties.
- **Water Management:** Efficient irrigation and mulching.

## Benefits

- Improves soil organic matter and microbial diversity.
- Reduces pollution from agrochemicals.
- Produces healthier foods.
