# Water Conservation in Agriculture

## Importance

Water conservation is crucial in agriculture to sustain productivity amidst increasing water scarcity, climate variability, and competition for freshwater resources.

## Techniques

- **Micro-Irrigation:** Drip and sprinkler systems that minimize water loss and target root zones.
- **Rainwater Harvesting:** Collecting and storing runoff in ponds, tanks, or aquifers.
- **Mulching:** Applying organic or plastic covers to reduce evaporation.
- **Contour Farming and Terracing:** Techniques to reduce runoff and increase infiltration on slopes.
- **Crop Selection:** Drought-tolerant and early-maturing varieties reduce water demand.
- **Scheduling and Precision Irrigation:** Using sensors and climate data to time irrigation optimally.

## Benefits

- Saves water and energy.
- Enhances water use efficiency.
- Improves crop yields and quality.
- Reduces soil erosion and nutrient leaching.

## Government Initiatives

India aims to expand micro-irrigation to millions of hectares via subsidies and extension services by 2025.
