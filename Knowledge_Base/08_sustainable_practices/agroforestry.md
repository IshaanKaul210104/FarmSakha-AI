# Agroforestry

## Overview

Agroforestry is a land-use system integrating trees, crops, and livestock on the same plot to optimize productivity, ecological sustainability, and economic benefits. It mimics natural ecosystems to build resilience and diversify farm income sources.

## Types of Agroforestry

- **Silvopasture:** Combining trees with pasture and livestock grazing.
- **Alley Cropping:** Growing crops in alleys formed by rows of trees or shrubs.
- **Windbreaks and Shelterbelts:** Rows of trees or shrubs protecting crops and soil from wind erosion.
- **Home Gardens:** Diverse plant species grown near homes for food, medicine, and income.
- **Taungya System:** Growing crops with young forestry plantations during the early years.

## Benefits

- Improved soil fertility through nitrogen fixation and organic matter input.
- Enhanced biodiversity, habitat provision for beneficial organisms.
- Microclimate regulation, reducing temperature extremes and water evaporation.
- Carbon sequestration aiding climate change mitigation.
- Diversification of income through timber, fruits, fodder, and medicinal plants.
- Reduced soil erosion and improved water retention.

## Challenges

- Requires knowledge-intensive management and longer time horizons for returns.
- Potential competition between trees and crops for light, water, and nutrients.
- Policy and institutional barriers to implementation.

## Best Practices

- Species selection suited to local agro-climatic conditions.
- Spatial arrangement optimizing resource use and minimizing competition.
- Integration with soil and water conservation measures.
- Market development for diversified products.
