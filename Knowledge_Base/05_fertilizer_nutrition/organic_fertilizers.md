# Organic Fertilizers

Organic fertilizers are derived from natural sources such as plant residues, animal manure, compost, and other biodegradable organic materials. They are essential for improving soil fertility, structure, and microbial activity.

## Types of Organic Fertilizers

- **Animal Manures:** Cow dung, poultry manure, pig manure, rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
- **Compost:** Decomposed organic matter providing balanced nutrient content and soil conditioning.
- **Green Manures:** Cover crops like legumes grown and incorporated into soil to fix nitrogen and improve fertility.
- **Biofertilizers:** Microorganisms such as Rhizobium, Azotobacter, mycorrhizae that enhance nutrient availability.
- **Other Sources:** Bone meal, rock phosphate, seaweed extracts.

## Benefits

- Slow release of nutrients reduces leaching
- Enhances soil organic matter, texture, water retention, and cation exchange capacity
- Promotes beneficial microbial populations
- Sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to chemical fertilizers
- Improves long-term soil health and productivity

## Application Methods

- Incorporation into soil during land preparation
- Side dressing or top dressing in row crops
- Foliar application in liquid form for some biofertilizers
- Compost tea or vermicompost solutions

## Limitations and Considerations

- Nutrient content varies widely; requires proper nutrient analysis
- Bulk and slower availability compared to synthetic fertilizers
- Potential for pathogen contamination if improperly processed
- Integration with inorganic fertilizers recommended for balanced crop nutrition
