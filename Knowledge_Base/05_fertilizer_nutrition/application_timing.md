# Fertilizer Application Timing

# Fertilizer Application Timing

Applying fertilizers at the appropriate time during crop growth is vital to ensure nutrient availability coincides with plant demand, maximizing uptake efficiency and crop productivity while minimizing losses and environmental impacts.

## Crop Growth Stages and Nutrient Demand

- **Basal Application:** Applied before or at planting to supply phosphorus and potassium that support root development and early growth.
- **Tillering Stage:** Nitrogen application at tillering supports vegetative growth and tiller formation, critical in cereals like rice and wheat.
- **Panicle Initiation/Booting:** Critical for reproductive development and grain formation, timely nitrogen boosts grain number and quality.
- **Grain Filling:** Nutrients supplied in this stage help improve grain weight and quality.

## Split Application of Nitrogen

- Dividing nitrogen doses reduces volatilization, leaching, and denitrification losses.
- Typical splits for cereals: 30-50% basal, 30-40% tillering, and 20-30% at panicle initiation or booting.

## Foliar Fertilizer Application

- Provides quick correction of micronutrient deficiencies
- Effective during critical physiological stages for immediate nutrient supply, e.g., zinc, iron, boron sprays

## Site- and Crop-Specific Factors

- Soil nutrient status, moisture conditions, fertilizer type, and crop growth rate influence timing decisions.
- Use of controlled-release fertilizers can reduce the frequency of applications.

## Environmental Considerations

- Avoid fertilizer application before heavy rains to reduce runoff.
- Apply fertilizers when soil temperature and moisture favor nutrient uptake.
