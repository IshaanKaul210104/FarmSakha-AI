# Micronutrients in Crop Nutrition

Micronutrients are essential elements required in small quantities by plants to support vital physiological functions such as enzyme activation, photosynthesis, and hormone regulation.

## Key Micronutrients and Functions

- **Zinc (Zn):** Involved in enzyme activation and protein synthesis. Deficiency causes stunted growth and leaf chlorosis.
- **Iron (Fe):** Central to chlorophyll synthesis and electron transport in photosynthesis.
- **Manganese (Mn):** Participates in photosynthesis, nitrogen assimilation, and enzyme activation.
- **Copper (Cu):** Important for lignin synthesis and reproductive growth.
- **Boron (B):** Crucial for cell wall formation and seed development.
- **Molybdenum (Mo):** Required for nitrogen fixation and nitrate reduction.
- **Chlorine (Cl):** Involved in osmosis and ionic balance.

## Symptoms of Deficiencies

- Yellowing or chlorosis, necrotic spots, poor root development, reduced flowering, and malformed fruits are common deficiency symptoms.
- Plus interactions between micronutrients and with macronutrients affect uptake and utilization.

## Sources and Application

- Micronutrients are applied via soil amendments, foliar sprays, seed treatment, or fertigation.
- Chelated forms improve availability in alkaline or calcareous soils.

## Importance in Sustainable Agriculture

- Micronutrient management enhances yield, crop quality, stress tolerance, and nutrient use efficiency.
- Prevents hidden hunger in crops, leading to nutritional improvement in human food products.
