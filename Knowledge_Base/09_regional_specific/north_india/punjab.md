# Punjab: Agriculture and Regional Practices

## Overview

Punjab, known as the "Granary of India," plays a crucial role in food grain production, especially wheat and rice. The region benefits from fertile alluvial soils and extensive irrigation infrastructure primarily drawn from the Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi rivers.

## Climate

- Semi-arid to sub-humid with hot summers and cold winters.
- Monsoon season from July to September brings most rainfall.
- Irrigation dependent during dry periods.

## Key Crops

- Wheat and rice dominate cropping patterns.
- Other important crops include maize, cotton, sugarcane, and pulses.
- High fertilizer and pesticide usage characterize intensification.

## Agricultural Practices

- Predominantly intensive, mechanized farming systems.
- Extensive use of tubewells and canal irrigation.
- Crop rotation with rice-wheat systems prevalent.
- Challenges include declining groundwater levels and soil degradation.

## Regional Challenges

- Water scarcity and groundwater depletion.
- Soil salinity and fertility loss due to intensive cropping.
- Pest resistance and cost escalation in inputs.
- Need for diversification and sustainable practices.

## Innovations and Policy

- Encouragement of direct-seeded rice and zero-till farming.
- Promotion of micro-irrigation and balanced fertilization.
- Government schemes incentivizing sustainable water use.
