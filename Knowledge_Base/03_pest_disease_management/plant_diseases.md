# Plant Diseases

Plant diseases are disorders in plants caused by infectious pathogens (like fungi, bacteria, viruses, phytoplasmas, nematodes) or by adverse environmental conditions (nutrient deficiencies, pollutants, weather extremes). They pose major threats to crop production, global food security, and economic stability.

## Categories of Plant Diseases

- **Fungal:** Rusts, smuts, mildews, wilts (e.g., Puccinia, Fusarium, Rhizopus)
- **Bacterial:** Wilts, blights, cankers (e.g., Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas)
- **Viral:** Mosaic, leaf curl, yellowing, stunting (e.g., Tobacco mosaic virus, Begomoviruses)
- **Nematode and Phytoplasma:** Root knots, witches' broom
- **Non-Infectious:** Abiotic stresses, nutrient imbalances

Diseases may be classified as:
- **Airborne:** Spread via wind, causing blight, rust, and powdery mildew.
- **Vector-Borne:** Transmitted by insects.
- **Localized/Systemic:** Affecting specific plant parts or the whole plant.
- **Monocyclic, Polycyclic, Polyetic:** Differing by number of infectious cycles per season[web:27].

## Symptoms

- **Spots:** Localized necrosis with color changes
- **Blights:** Rapid wilting and death of tissues
- **Blasts:** Sudden death of buds or inflorescences
- **Scorch:** Leaf margin necrosis with irregular patterns
- **Cankers, Scabs:** Necrotic lesions or rough epidermal outgrowths
- **Rots:** Decay of tissues; soft, wet, and sometimes slimy
- **Anthracnose:** Sunken lesions with defined margins
- **Wilts:** Drooping and loss of turgor pressure

## Disease Cycle

The progression of plant diseases can be monocyclic (one infection cycle per season) or polycyclic (multiple cycles), impacting the approach to management[web:27].

## Principles and Methods of Disease Management

- **Avoidance:** Altering timing/location to escape conditions favoring infection
- **Exclusion:** Quarantines, use of certified seed, and clean equipment
- **Eradication:** Crop rotation, destruction of infected material, and soil treatments
- **Protection:** Fungicides, bactericides, physical barriers
- **Resistance:** Use of resistant/tolerant plant varieties (traditional breeding or biotechnology)
- **Therapy:** Curative interventions, including heat and chemical treatments
- **Cultural Practices:** Optimized irrigation, spacing, fertilizer application to reduce disease incidence
- **Biological Control:** Encouraging antagonistic microbes or natural plant defenses

## Integrated Disease Management

Modern strategies emphasize combining cultural, chemical, and biological approaches for sustainability and resilience in agroecosystems. Disease management should be site- and pathogen-specific, informed by diagnosis, surveillance, and risk assessment[web:20][web:27][web:34][web:37].
