# Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a holistic, ecosystem-based strategy for sustainable pest and disease management that emphasizes the integration of multiple control tactics to maintain pest populations at levels below those causing economic injury, while minimizing risks to human health, non-target organisms, and the environment.

## Concept and Evolution

Originally developed for agriculture, IPM has expanded to landscape, forestry, public health, and structural pest management. It is grounded in knowledge of pest biology, population dynamics, and ecosystem interactions[web:29][web:26].

## Core Elements of IPM

### Prevention

- Selecting resistant or tolerant crop varieties
- Crop rotation and intercropping to break pest life cycles
- Sanitary practices (removal of infested plant materials, cleaning tools)
- Soil health management to favor beneficial organisms

### Identification and Surveillance

- Correct identification of pests, beneficial organisms, and diseases is crucial for targeted action[web:26].
- Regular monitoring (scouting, traps, degree-day models) tracks pest and natural enemy populations and environmental conditions[web:29].
- Surveillance data inform risk assessment and forecasting outbreaks.

### Thresholds and Decision-Making

- **Economic Threshold:** The pest density at which the cost of damage equals the cost of control.
- **Action Threshold:** The level at which intervention should be applied to prevent pest populations from exceeding the economic injury level.
- These thresholds prevent unnecessary interventions, saving costs and reducing non-target impacts.

### Multi-Tactic Control Measures

- **Biological:** Conservation/augmentation of natural enemies
- **Cultural:** Crop management, rotation, sanitation, adjusted planting schedules
- **Physical/Mechanical:** Barriers, traps, soil solarization, manual removal
- **Chemical:** Selective and minimized use of pesticides, rotated for resistance management
- **Biotechnological:** Genetically engineered crops and biological pesticides

### Implementation and Evaluation

- Regular data collection before and after intervention ensures efficacy and corrective adaptation.
- Recording of management actions, outcomes, chemical applications, and ecological side effects is recommended for continuous improvement[web:31].

## Benefits of IPM

- Environmental and human health protection due to reduced pesticide reliance
- Prevents or delays the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations
- Enhances biodiversity and agroecosystem resilience
- Potential for greater long-term economic returns for producers[web:33][web:36]
